This code performs a basic data visualization analysis on a dataset containing ages and genders. It begins by importing necessary libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas) and creating a DataFrame from a dictionary with Age and Gender columns. The first visualization is a bar chart showing the distribution of genders using Seaborn's countplot, with a title and labeled axes. Next, the code generates a histogram to display the distribution of ages. Two histograms are plotted: the first uses blue bars and the second uses green bars with a grid for better readability. The second histogram's labels are adjusted to provide clarity, and the histogram is saved as an image file named age_distribution.png. This analysis visually represents the gender distribution and age distribution within the dataset, allowing for easy interpretation of the data's characteristics.
